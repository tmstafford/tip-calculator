                    Tipping in Canada generally follows the same rules as the United States. However, the hourly rates for service employees are typically higher in Canada than they are 
                    in the US, so things like tip jars on counters are not likely to be seen, and the extra cash tip isn't as necessary.

                    Usually, it is recommended to stick with typical US tipping habits if traveling to Mexico.

                    even if the bill says "service not included". An additional tip on top of the service charge is not required and is not considered "custom practice", however the

                    but make sure to get your money exchanged before getting served in Brazil. Currently 1 Brazilian Real = 0.19 US Dollars.

                    is included in the total. But the French service staff won't turn down a "pourboire", a French colloquial term for tips, so rounding off your bill or leaving

                    service. In Dubai, the government requires all bars, restaurants, and hotels to add a 10% service charge to bills. With the 
                    service charge, simply round out the bill with a few dirhams. There are some circumstances in the UAE where tipping is considered rude. The 
                    most notable example involves tipping bathroom attendants, so be sure to check for further standards.
